I am looking to create a static JSON api, and host it on GitHub Pages so it can be used publicly. From my understanding, all I need is a JSON file with my data, and once I publish it to GitHub pages, it will be accessible from this URL:

http://username.github.io/repo_name/json_file_name
This is my JSON file, with some of the data.

[
  {
    "id": "0001",
    "name": "Walleye",
    "scientific": "Sander Vitreus",
    "environment": "Fresh Water",
    "climate": {
      "min": "",
      "max": ""
    },
    "depth": {
      "min": "0",
      "max": "27",
      "avMin": "",
      "avMax": ""
    },
    "length": {
      "common": "54",
      "max": "107"
    },
    "weight": {
      "common": "",
      "max": "11.3"
    },
    "maxAge": "29",
    "description": "Occurs in lakes, pools, backwaters, and runs of medium to large rivers. Frequently found in clear water, usually near brush..."
  },
  {

    },

      "max": "137"
    },
    "weight": {

  }
